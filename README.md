# House-Prices

My solution to the House Prices ML competition in Kaggle.

The House Prices is a famous competition in Kaggle where the mission is to predict house prices by many features of each house.

## EDA

In the EDA phase, I explored the data. I checked the distribution of many features, the correlation between features to the target value, and the connection between different features.

## Data Pre-processing

In this phase, I handled missing values, outliers, and categorial features.

## Training

In the training phase, I used cross-validation, regularization, and feature selection techniques in order to reduce overfitting.


## Predictions

Finally, I predicted and submitted my results.
